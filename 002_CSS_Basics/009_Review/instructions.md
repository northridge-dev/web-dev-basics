# Review of Basic CSS

Congrats! You made it through the first set of CSS challenges. Let's take a
moment to review what you've learned. If you can answer these questions, you're
in good shape.

1. What does CSS stand for?
2. Style rules have a **style property** and a **value** and look like this:
   `property: value;`. Give an example of a style property and a value that
   might be used.
3. We've looked at four different ways to select which elements a style rule
   will apply to. List them.
4. What is an **inline** style rule? How do you add one?
5. In a style sheet, how do you distinguish between an ID selector, a class
   selector, and a tag selector?
6. Style rules can conflict. How does your browser resolve these conflicts?
