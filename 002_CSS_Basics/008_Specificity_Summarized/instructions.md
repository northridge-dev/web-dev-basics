# (Simplified) Specificity Summarized

Based on our experiments, here's how specificity shakes out (most to least
specific):

1. inline styles
2. style by ID
3. style by class
4. style by tag

In truth, the specificity rules get more complex when you're dealing with more
complicated **selectors**. We may get ourselves in a situation where we'll need
to brush up on [those complications](https://thevalleyofcode.com/css/4-specificity){:target="\_blank"}.
For now, we're better served practicing these simpler rules.

The starter code contains some unstyled HTML. Adding style is your job. Please
add:

- at least one inline style
- at least one ID and a style defined with an ID selector
- at least one class and a style defined with an class selector
- at least one style defined with a class selector
- at least one style conflict

Want to make it beautiful? Go for it. Want to see how ugly you can make it.
That's cool, too. Practice is practice.
