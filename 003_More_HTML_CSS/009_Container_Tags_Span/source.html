<h1>Highlight the Most Important Bits</h1>
<p>
  You'll focus better, remember more, and be able to quickly scan a text if you
  highlight the most important parts. But don't highlight too much. If more than
  about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub><sup>th</sup> of the text is highlighted,
  it's probably too much.
