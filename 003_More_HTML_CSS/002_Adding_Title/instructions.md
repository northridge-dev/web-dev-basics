# Adding a Title

Ever notice that most browser tabs have a title? It's set in with a special `<title>`
tag.

Try adding a title to the starter code. Make sure to place it somewhere in the
document's `<head>`. It'll look something like this:

```html
<title>My Awesome Title</title>
```

Because the HTML you're writing is being rendered in the preview pane, it won't
change the title in the browser tab. So you can see the title, I've added a
little `<script>` -- a bit of JavaScript that reads the HTML document, plucks
out the title you've set, and adds it to the body of the text when you reload
the preview pane by clicking the ▶ button.

You don't have to worry now about how it works, but it might be interesting to
see a little JavaScript and how it can be added to an HTML document. Once
you've successfully added a title, click the ✔ button.
