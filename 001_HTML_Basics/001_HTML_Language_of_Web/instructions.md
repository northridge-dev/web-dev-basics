# HTML: The Language of the Web

Web pages are written in HTML:

- **H**yper
- **T**ext
- **M**arkup
- **L**anguage

We'll worry about what those terms mean soon enough. To start, let's see an
example.

What you see in the editor is HTML. It's just text with some special **tags**.
They come in pairs, an opening and a closing tag:

- `<h1>` and `<\h1>`
- `<p>` and `<\p>`

To the side, in the "Web Page" tab, you can see what the browser makes of that HTML.

Try changing the text between the tags and clicking the ▶ button to update
the page view. What happens if you remove the closing `<h1>` tag? What happens
if you change the `<h1>` and `<\h1>` tags to `<h2>` and `<\h2>`?

After you've experimented a bit, click the ✓ button to move to the next challenge.
