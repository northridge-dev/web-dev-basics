# Mini Project: Profile Page

You've already learned a lot about HTML. To bring it all together, try
creating a profile page.

Your profile should:

- Have your name at the top. Use a header tag for this.
- Include a short bio inside one or more paragraph tags.
- In your bio, emphasize (`<em>`) or mark as important (`<strong>`) at least
  one word or phrase.
- Include a list -- ordered or unordered -- of important facts about you.
- Includes an image of your Hall's coat of arms. If, for example, you're in
  Paladin, you'd use the following URL as the `src` attribute in your `<img>`
  tag: `https://northridge.dev/static/images/paladin.png`.

When you've finished, show it off. Congratulations! You're officially a web developer.
