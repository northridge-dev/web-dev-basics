# Ordered Lists

In the previous challenge, you saw _unordered_ or _bulleted_ lists. HTML also
supports _ordered_ lists, where each item in the list is numbered.

It's pretty simple to transform the unordered list in the starter code into an
ordered list. Just swap out the `<ul>` tag for an `<ol>` tag. Give it a try.

Too easy? Try creating a nested list where the top level of the list is ordered and
the second level of the list is unordered:

```text
Shopping list:
1. produce
  - apples
  - broccoli
2. dairy
  - milk
  - cheese
3. bakery
  - bread
  - cookies
```

Now that you're a master of HTML lists (both ordered and unordered), click the âœ”
button to master something new.
