# Unordered Lists

Often, text is organized into lists.

```text
Shopping list:
- apples
- bread
- milk
```

Look at the starter code to see how `<ul>` (unordered list) and `<li>` (list
item) tags are used to create something similar in HTML. To make lists, we need
two different tags used in combination.

See if you can add a few more items to the list.

Want a harder challenge? See if you can figure out how to make a nested list, like so:

```text
Shopping list:
- produce
  - apples
  - broccoli
- dairy
  - milk
  - cheese
- bakery
  - bread
  - cookies
```

Hint: Can a `<ul>` tag be nested inside another `<ul>` tag?
