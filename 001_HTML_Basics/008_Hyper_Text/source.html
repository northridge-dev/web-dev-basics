  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Hypertext is a system of managing and presenting text, where the text is
    interconnected through links. These links allow users to navigate between
    different pieces of content in a non-linear fashion, providing a more
    flexible and interactive experience. Unlike traditional text, which is read
    sequentially from beginning to end, hypertext allows readers to choose their
    path through the material.

  <h2>History of Hypertext</h2>
  <p>
    The concept of hypertext dates back to the mid-20th century. It was first
    proposed by Vannevar Bush in his 1945 essay "As We May Think," where he
    described a hypothetical machine called the "Memex" that would store all of
    an individual's books, records, and communications and make them accessible
    through associative links. However, it wasn't until the 1960s that the term
    "hypertext" was coined by Ted Nelson. Nelson envisioned a system of linked
    documents that could be navigated easily, which laid the foundation for what
    would eventually become the World Wide Web.

  <h2>Components of Hypertext</h2>
  <p>Hypertext is composed of several key components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Nodes:</strong> These are the individual pieces of content or
      documents that make up the hypertext system. Each node can contain text,
      images, videos, or other media.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Links:</strong> Links are the connections between nodes. They
      allow users to navigate from one node to another. Links are typically
      embedded in the text and are often highlighted in some way, such as being
      underlined or colored differently.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Anchors:</strong> Anchors are the points within a node where a
      link begins or ends. In HTML, anchors are created using the
      <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, with the <code>href</code> attribute
      specifying the target location.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Importance of Hypertext</h2>
  <p>
    Hypertext revolutionized the way information is accessed and shared. It has
    become a fundamental component of the World Wide Web, enabling the vast
    interconnected network of information that we rely on today. By allowing
    users to quickly jump between related topics, hypertext has made it easier
    to explore and discover new information. This non-linear approach to reading
    and learning has opened up new possibilities for education, research, and
    communication.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, hypertext has made it possible to create dynamic, interactive
    documents that can be easily updated and expanded. This flexibility has
    contributed to the rapid growth of online content, making it possible for
    anyone to share their knowledge and ideas with a global audience.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In summary, hypertext is a powerful tool that has transformed the way we
    interact with information. By allowing for the creation of interconnected
    documents, it has enabled a more dynamic and engaging way of accessing
    content. Whether you are reading an article, exploring a website, or
    following a tutorial, hypertext allows you to navigate through the material
    in a way that best suits your needs and interests. Its importance in the
    digital age cannot be overstated, as it continues to play a crucial role in
    the way we communicate and learn.
